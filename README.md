# Memory Game Web Application

I am creating a memory game web application using the following techologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- Redux

You can try the game by visiting the URL below:
TODO: need to add URL
TODO: add a snapshot of the game

## Game Requirements

Here are the requirements for the game:

- User should be able to choose the number of pairs to match (ie. difficulty) up to ?? pairs
- There should be a timer to see how long the user takes to complete challenge
- Core game mechanics:
  - User select game settings
  - User initiate the game via a start button
  - After game initiates, user has ?? seconds to memorize the pairs
  - After ?? seconds, all pairs will flip over
  - Game ends when user has matched all pairs
- User can pause the game
  - When game is paused, pause message pops up with "Resume" button and background is blurred
- User can restart the game
- When game ends, a congratulation message will pop up
  - The message includes the following:
    - Congratulations message
    - Recorded time
    - Best recorded time
    - "Play again" button
    - "Play another game with different settings" button
    - "Feedback" button (to send feedback on how to make the game better)
